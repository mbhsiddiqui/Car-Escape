# Car-Escape
 
This repository contains two scripts which are integrated to build an application named Car-Escape. 

## Map.py 
This script is designed to function as a path finder which has two possible scenarios to operate into. Firstly, based on the starting point and ending , the script will deduce the shortest path to the ending point and outputs it. Secondly, based on the given starting point only, the script will determine a way to exit the map by itself. This second method only has human intervention at the initial step where it takes input from the user. The path determination is done completely by the designed algorithm alone.

## MapTest.py
This script utilizes Map.py and shows the user the final look of how the Map.py works in the background.
